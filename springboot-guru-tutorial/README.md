# springboot-guru-tutorial
Another tutorial to build a basic springboot webapp based on [the trail](https://springframework.guru/spring-boot-web-application-part-1-spring-initializr/) nicely provided by John Thomson on his valuable [Spring framework Guru's blog](https://springframework.guru/) 

## Disclaimer
I have changed naming of the project: ``` group = 'net.sinou.sandbox' `` and base package ```net.sinou.sandbox.sbgtuto`` in order to insure that there is no non-understood magic hidden around.

This is interesting to compare with the similar JEE tutorial (my personal draft dummy implementation [here](https://github.com/bsinou/netbeans-B2C-tutorial.git).
